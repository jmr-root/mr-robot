            Socially inept Elliot Alderson works at cyber security company Allsafe. At night, he hacks social media, personal information,
            and bank records, including those of his co-workers, therapist, and a drug dealer. Elliot stops a DDoS attack against Allsafe's
            biggest client, E Corp. He identifies a file labeled fsociety00.dat and a text file asking him not to destroy malware he finds
            hidden on E Corp's server. Mr. Robot, the mysterious leader of the hacker group fsociety, contacts Elliot on the subway.
            Fsociety invites Elliot to join them in starting a digital revolution; they plan to delete all debt records held by E Corp. He
            is intrigued and eventually agrees. As his first collaborative act with fsociety, Elliot provides the FBI with an encrypted file
            falsely implicating Terry Colby, E Corp's own chief technology officer (CTO) as the orchestrator of the attack.

            A brief flashback shows that Tyrell recorded an fsociety video the night he visited Elliot. One month later, Elliot has gone off
            the grid, living with his mother and maintaining a repetitive routine in an attempt to weaken the influence of Mr. Robot, who
            continually appears to him and torments him while still refusing to tell him what happened to Tyrell. fsociety continues under
            Darlene's leadership, hacking the smart home of E Corp general counsel Susan Jacobs and using it as home base after forcing
            Jacobs to move out. Gideon visits Elliot, tells him that Allsafe is no more and the FBI thinks he is behind the hack or at least
            complicit in some way. With Mobley's assistance, Darlene executes a hack on the Bank of E Corp, holding their records for
            ransom.

            Zhang intends for Elliot to die once his work for the Dark Army is complete. In a panic that Elliot might die, Tyrell calls used
            car salesman and Dark Army agent Irving. Elliot wakes up a week later in a room with Angela. He finds the firmware hack building
            empty. Darlene shows up and pumps him for information, but he lies and says Tyrell was never involved. With the power still out,
            she takes him to an underground hacker tournament with fiber connections. He shuts the backdoor into E Corp, but Dark Army
            agents force them to leave. Irving shakes their FBI tail and Elliot thinks he has called off Stage 2. Thinking his revolution
            made things worse, he asks Angela for a job at E Corp to fix things. That night, Mr. Robot emerges and Angela takes him to work
            with Irving and Tyrell, creating another way to advance Stage 2. Angela plans to manipulate Elliot along with Mr. Robot,
            believing in Whiterose's plan to undo everything E Corp has ever done and create a new world.

            The season picks up from the previous season with Angela's conversation with Price. Angela demands revenge against Whiterose,
            but Price tries and fails to talk her out of it. While he walks away, Dark Army agents show up and kill Angela. Whiterose gives
            Elliot until the end of December to live, sending him a picture of Angela's body as a warning. In mid-December, Tyrell has
            become sullen and bored as the CTO puppet. Dominique has moved in with her mother and becomes very paranoid; her mother's new
            friend Janice is her new Dark Army handler, warning her to return to work to clean up Santiago's mess. Elliot and Mr. Robot work
            together to blackmail a lawyer, Freddy, and are able to get information that Whiterose uses Cyprus National Bank and John
            Garcin. Freddy kills himself when he realizes the Dark Army is after him. Darlene has fallen into addiction over guilt about
            Angela's disappearance (Elliot cannot bring himself to show her the proof of her death). Elliot investigates John Garcin, but it
            is a trap. Elliot is dragged away and injected by three men; he thinks he is about to die. The men revive him and Price reveals
            himself.
