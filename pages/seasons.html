                  against Allsafe's biggest client, E Corp. He identifies a file labeled fsociety00.dat and a text file asking him not to
                  destroy malware he finds hidden on E Corp's server. Mr. Robot, the mysterious leader of the hacker group fsociety,
                  contacts Elliot on the subway. Fsociety invites Elliot to join them in starting a digital revolution; they plan to delete
                  all debt records held by E Corp. He is intrigued and eventually agrees. As his first collaborative act with fsociety,
                  Elliot provides the FBI with an encrypted file falsely implicating Terry Colby, E Corp's own chief technology officer
                  (CTO) as the orchestrator of the attack.

                  Elliot backs out because he does not want to risk lives. Shayla is Elliot's drug dealer and friend. When Elliot notices

                  pushes Elliot off a railing onto the rock-strewn beach below as punishment for not keeping his father's secret.

                  home. Angry, Elliot pushes Mr. Robot out of a window and then takes him to a graveyard. Mr. Robot tells Elliot not to let
                  Angela and Darlene "get rid of him", and that he will always love him. When they arrive, Elliot, alone at the grave of his
                  father, realizes he had taken on his dead father's persona the entire time, saying "I am Mr. Robot". Terry Colby offers
                  Angela a job at E Corp. Elliot now doubts the continuation of his Mr. Robot/fsociety plan. Tyrell threatens Elliot about
                  fsociety's plan – Elliot takes Tyrell to the arcade and understands that he will carry on with the hack. They agree to
                  work together, but Elliot glances over to the popcorn machine where Darlene's gun is hidden.

                  A brief flashback shows that Tyrell recorded an fsociety video the night he visited Elliot. One month later, Elliot has
                  gone off the grid, living with his mother and maintaining a repetitive routine in an attempt to weaken the influence of
                  Mr. Robot, who continually appears to him and torments him while still refusing to tell him what happened to Tyrell.
                  fsociety continues under Darlene's leadership, hacking the smart home of E Corp general counsel Susan Jacobs and using it
                  as home base after forcing Jacobs to move out. Gideon visits Elliot, tells him that Allsafe is no more and the FBI thinks
                  he is behind the hack or at least complicit in some way. With Mobley's assistance, Darlene executes a hack on the Bank of
                  E Corp, holding their records for ransom.

                  months, he's released 86 days later due to cost control measures. Darlene informs him Mobley and Trenton are missing.
                  Through Cisco, they hack a Dark Army agent's phone to monitor conversations referring to a "Stage 2." Angela hacks E Corp
                  herself, discovering the toxic waste leak at the Washington Township plant wasn't fixed, though grows too suspicious to be
                  a whistleblower; Dominique tells her she's running out of options. Darlene left an fsociety tape with her face at Susan's
                  house; Cisco retrieves it and hears someone. Whiterose had arranged the death of the previous E Corp CEO for interfering
                  with the plant. Price is able to calm Zhang (Whiterose) by saying he can keep the plant if China loans E Corp some bailout
                  money as goodwill. Elliot and Mr. Robot notice that they are somehow disconnecting from each other. Darlene hears the Dark
                  Army say Stage 2 is Elliot's plan as someone knocks at her door. Waiting for Elliot outside his apartment is Joanna.

                  Cisco finds one of fsociety's members badly wounded and persuades Darlene that he needs a hospital. A witness identifies
                  Cisco leaving Susan's house and the authorities begin to investigate if her vacation is really a disappearance. Despite
                  Dominique's protests that the Dark Army will attack, Cisco's image is released to the media as a Five/Nine suspect. The
                  BOLO is later seen by the hospital's ER staff, who report his location. Joanna persuades Elliot to track the phone she
                  believes was left by Tyrell. Elliot traces the call to a nearby residence, but Mr. Sutherland thinks it won't be Tyrell
                  based on the location. Elliot and Angela later meet on the subway to talk. She makes him realize there are more gaps in
                  his memory and warns him not to trust Mr. Robot. Defeated, Angela intends to confess with her lawyer, admitting her part
                  in the FBI hack. After sharing a kiss with Elliot, she is approached by two figures. Dominique tracks Darlene and Cisco to
                  a restaurant but, while she's inside, a Dark Army shooter opens fire on them, and she emerges from the restaurant covered
                  in splattered blood.

Elliot wakes up a week later in a room with Angela. He finds the firmware hack building empty. Darlene shows up and pumps him for information, but he lies and says Tyrell was never involved. With the power still out, she takes him to an underground hacker tournament with fiber connections. He shuts the backdoor into E Corp, but Dark Army agents force them to leave. Irving shakes their FBI tail and Elliot thinks he has called off Stage 2. Thinking his revolution made things worse, he asks Angela for a job at E Corp to fix things. That night, Mr. Robot emerges and Angela takes him to work with Irving and Tyrell, creating another way to advance Stage 2. Angela plans to manipulate Elliot along with Mr. Robot, believing in Whiterose's plan to undo everything E Corp has ever done and create a new world.

Irving and the Dark Army appear, stating Gideon told the FBI that Tyrell shut down the honeypot, making him the prime suspect of the hack. They take Tyrell to a cabin in a secluded area. The psych evaluation breaks him, but he admits he will always be loyal to Elliot. Zhang begins working on both Tyrell and Elliot. Tyrell is given secure access to engineer Stage 2 with Cisco's firmware. The reports of Joanna moving on make Tyrell snap and go for a walk, whereupon he is arrested by a local police officer. The officer is killed by FBI Agent Santiago, another Dark Army plant and Dominique's superior, thereby ensuring that nobody knows about Tyrell. Irving is able to calm Tyrell, saying he can win his family back when this is over. Irving checks on Elliot through Leon. Tyrell is taken to a Dark Army-controlled hotel and is excited to meet Elliot again. After having to tranquilize him, Angela explains Mr. Robot's existence to Tyrell. After the surgery, Mr. Robot awakens and smiles at Tyrell for following the plan.

He tries calling in a bomb threat to get the target building evacuated, while a large gathering of anti E Corp protesters gathers at headquarters. Darlene appears, admitting she's working with the FBI and that Angela is working with Mr. Robot, helping Elliot remember his lost days. The protesters break into E Corp, terrifying the workers. Irving calls Angela, stating that the riot is a distraction so they can send Elliot to copy important data from an HSM in a secure room as a prerequisite to Stage 2. Angela hears that the UN agreed to the annexation, then is approached by a suspicious security guard. She attracts the protesters, who attack the security guard, so she can complete the assignment intended for Elliot, then passes the data to a Dark Army agent. Elliot confronts her in the chaos, asking if there's something she needs to tell him.

Darlene tells the truth to the FBI, also stating she knows the Dark Army owns them. Santiago panics and calls Irving. Through Irving and Leon, Elliot meets with Zhang's assistant for a fake Stage 3; their scan of his laptop gives him access to the Dark Army. Whiterose is outraged that moving the plant to Congo will take a month. She gives permission for Elliot to die.

                    Dominique and Darlene, kidnapped by Santiago after finding out his double agent status, and Elliot are brought to an abandoned barn. Santiago and Dominique go outside to Irving where Santiago is killed and Dominique is forced to be the new FBI mole. Inside, Whiterose’s assistant Grant prepares to kill Elliot and Darlene. Elliot devises a plan to move Whiterose’s plant to the Congo sooner, which Elliot is allowed to try. Grant kills himself when Whiterose says he is no longer of any use. Elliot succeeds in moving the plant and the ordeal comes to an end with everyone safe. Darlene tries apologizing to Dominique but she refuses the apology out of hatred. Dominique gives Elliot access to the FBI, where he learns that Romero wasn’t responsible for the encryption keys; instead, Mr. Robot saved them, as it is what Elliot would want. The two make peace and vow to bring down the true villains of the world as Elliot reverses Five/Nine. Meanwhile, Angela is brought to Phillip Price’s house, where he reveals to her that he is her actual father and convinces her of Whiterose’s villainous nature. In a post-credits scene, Darlene is confronted by Vera in front of Elliot’s apartment.

                  The season picks up from the previous season with Angela's conversation with Price. Angela demands revenge against Whiterose, but Price tries and fails to talk her out of it. While he walks away, Dark Army agents show up and kill Angela. Whiterose gives Elliot until the end of December to live, sending him a picture of Angela's body as a warning. In mid-December, Tyrell has become sullen and bored as the CTO puppet. Dominique has moved in with her mother and becomes very paranoid; her mother's new friend Janice is her new Dark Army handler, warning her to return to work to clean up Santiago's mess. Elliot and Mr. Robot work together to blackmail a lawyer, Freddy, and are able to get information that Whiterose uses Cyprus National Bank and John Garcin. Freddy kills himself when he realizes the Dark Army is after him. Darlene has fallen into addiction over guilt about Angela's disappearance (Elliot cannot bring himself to show her the proof of her death). Elliot investigates John Garcin, but it is a trap. Elliot is dragged away and injected by three men; he thinks he is about to die. The men revive him and Price reveals himself.

Price knows that former E-Corp employee Susan Jacobs had Dark Army ties before her disappearance and tells Elliot to get to the Deus group's money through her. Elliot gets a call from Darlene telling him their mother has died. They find that their mother owned a safety deposit box, but the bank disposed of it before her death. Darlene admits she is really grieving for Angela. After the funeral, Darlene confesses to Elliot that she killed Susan Jacobs and joins him against Whiterose. She thanks him for taking care of Vera, who has returned. Elliot argues with Mr. Robot, with both of them denying any knowledge of Vera's return. In his mind, Elliot's mother tells a younger version of himself to wait for 'the other one.' Meanwhile, Dominique lies to the FBI about what happened to Santiago, only for her interrogator to be killed in a faux suicide by Janice. Price tells Zhang that he is resigning from E-Corp and thus cutting ties with the Dark Army, which will force the Deus group to meet in person to choose his successor.
