                  against Allsafe's biggest client, E Corp. He identifies a file labeled fsociety00.dat and a text file asking him not to
                  destroy malware he finds hidden on E Corp's server. Mr. Robot, the mysterious leader of the hacker group fsociety,
                  contacts Elliot on the subway. Fsociety invites Elliot to join them in starting a digital revolution; they plan to delete
                  all debt records held by E Corp. He is intrigued and eventually agrees. As his first collaborative act with fsociety,
                  Elliot provides the FBI with an encrypted file falsely implicating Terry Colby, E Corp's own chief technology officer
                  (CTO) as the orchestrator of the attack.

                  Elliot backs out because he does not want to risk lives. Shayla is Elliot's drug dealer and friend. When Elliot notices

                  pushes Elliot off a railing onto the rock-strewn beach below as punishment for not keeping his father's secret.

                  A flashback shows a young Elliot and his father in his computer repair shop "Mr. Robot". After the birth of their child,
                  Joanna tells Tyrell that he needs to keep in control if he "wants to be part of this family". Tyrell is fired from E Corp
                  – his final act is to prevent Gideon from reverting the honeypot. Mr. Robot takes a trip with Elliot to his childhood
                  home. Angry, Elliot pushes Mr. Robot out of a window and then takes him to a graveyard. Mr. Robot tells Elliot not to let
                  Angela and Darlene "get rid of him", and that he will always love him. When they arrive, Elliot, alone at the grave of his
                  father, realizes he had taken on his dead father's persona the entire time, saying "I am Mr. Robot". Terry Colby offers
                  Angela a job at E Corp. Elliot now doubts the continuation of his Mr. Robot/fsociety plan. Tyrell threatens Elliot about
                  fsociety's plan – Elliot takes Tyrell to the arcade and understands that he will carry on with the hack. They agree to
                  work together, but Elliot glances over to the popcorn machine where Darlene's gun is hidden.

                  her to help the police arrest Elliot, but she refuses. Elliot wakes up alone in Tyrell's SUV three days after the
                  conclusion of the previous episode, with no memory of those two days. The fsociety hack succeeded, throwing the world into
                  chaos and gathering cheering crowds throughout the city. fsociety encrypts their data and covers their tracks. E Corp is
                  readying an emergency TV interview. The E Corp EVP of Technology commits suicide on TV after stating that the situation is
                  hopeless. Elliot talks to Mr. Robot again and asks about Tyrell's location. He visits Tyrell's address but finds only
                  Joanna, introducing himself as "Ollie". The episode ends with Elliot opening his apartment door; the visitor is not seen.
                  In a post-credits scene, Whiterose, dressed as a man, and Phillip Price, the CEO of E Corp, are shown conversing at a
                  formal event where Price indicates he "knows who's responsible".

            A brief flashback shows that Tyrell recorded an fsociety video the night he visited Elliot. One month later, Elliot has gone off
            the grid, living with his mother and maintaining a repetitive routine in an attempt to weaken the influence of Mr. Robot, who
            continually appears to him and torments him while still refusing to tell him what happened to Tyrell. fsociety continues under
            Darlene's leadership, hacking the smart home of E Corp general counsel Susan Jacobs and using it as home base after forcing
            Jacobs to move out. Gideon visits Elliot, tells him that Allsafe is no more and the FBI thinks he is behind the hack or at least
            complicit in some way. With Mobley's assistance, Darlene executes a hack on the Bank of E Corp, holding their records for
            ransom.

            Zhang intends for Elliot to die once his work for the Dark Army is complete. In a panic that Elliot might die, Tyrell calls used
            car salesman and Dark Army agent Irving. Elliot wakes up a week later in a room with Angela. He finds the firmware hack building
            empty. Darlene shows up and pumps him for information, but he lies and says Tyrell was never involved. With the power still out,
            she takes him to an underground hacker tournament with fiber connections. He shuts the backdoor into E Corp, but Dark Army
            agents force them to leave. Irving shakes their FBI tail and Elliot thinks he has called off Stage 2. Thinking his revolution
            made things worse, he asks Angela for a job at E Corp to fix things. That night, Mr. Robot emerges and Angela takes him to work
            with Irving and Tyrell, creating another way to advance Stage 2. Angela plans to manipulate Elliot along with Mr. Robot,
            believing in Whiterose's plan to undo everything E Corp has ever done and create a new world.

            The season picks up from the previous season with Angela's conversation with Price. Angela demands revenge against Whiterose,
            but Price tries and fails to talk her out of it. While he walks away, Dark Army agents show up and kill Angela. Whiterose gives
            Elliot until the end of December to live, sending him a picture of Angela's body as a warning. In mid-December, Tyrell has
            become sullen and bored as the CTO puppet. Dominique has moved in with her mother and becomes very paranoid; her mother's new
            friend Janice is her new Dark Army handler, warning her to return to work to clean up Santiago's mess. Elliot and Mr. Robot work
            together to blackmail a lawyer, Freddy, and are able to get information that Whiterose uses Cyprus National Bank and John
            Garcin. Freddy kills himself when he realizes the Dark Army is after him. Darlene has fallen into addiction over guilt about
            Angela's disappearance (Elliot cannot bring himself to show her the proof of her death). Elliot investigates John Garcin, but it
            is a trap. Elliot is dragged away and injected by three men; he thinks he is about to die. The men revive him and Price reveals
            himself.
